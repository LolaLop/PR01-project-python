## Project Description
This project consists in the development of the Mastermind game. It includes two versions:
1. One to run via command line
2. One to run in a notebook (jupyter notebook)

## Rules
The objective is to guess the colour code within the minimum number of tries.
One player must chooses a combination (the colours can be repeated) and the other player has to guess it.
After each try, the second player gets the feedback indicating the number of:
   - Cows: For each colour which is correct but not in the good place
   - Bulls: For each colour which is correct and in the good position

## Workflow
The steps I followed to build this project were:
1. Build all the functions separately and test them
2. Once the functions were working, I tried them all together in once
3. Build the player class
4. Build the game class
5. Validation
6. Little improvements adding more comments for the users, adding level options, etc.

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

The repository includes 3 files:
