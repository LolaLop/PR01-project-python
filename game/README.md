## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about what what you chose to build and why. 

## Rules
The objective is to guess the colour code in less than the maximum number of tries.
The player must choose a combination (the colours can be repeated) and after each try, he will get a feedback indicating:
   - For each colour which is correct but not in the good place: a white
   - For each colour which is correct and in the good position: a black

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a trello or kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
